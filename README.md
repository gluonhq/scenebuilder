## Building Scene Builder ##

### Requisites ###

Gluon Scene Builder is frequently released, and this is only required in case you want to fork and build your local version of Scene Builder.

These are the requisites:

* A recent version of [JDK 11 or later](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) for building 'master' branch
* A recent version of [JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) for building '8u-dev' branch

### How to build Scene Builder ###

To build the Scene Builder services, on the project's root, run:

`mvn clean package`

It will create a partial shadow cross-platform jar under `app/target/lib/scenebuilder-$version.jar`, that doesn't include the JavaFX dependencies.

### How to run Scene Builder ###

Before starting the app, all dependencies must be installed locally.
This is achieved by:

`mvn install`

Then Scene Builder can be started with Maven:

`mvn javafx:run -f app`

Alternatively, you can run the partial shadow jar, providing you have downloaded the JavaFX SDK from [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/):

```
java 
--module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk-$javafxVersion/lib \
--add-modules javafx.web,javafx.fxml,javafx.swing,javafx.media \
--add-opens=javafx.fxml/javafx.fxml=ALL-UNNAMED \
-cp app/target/lib/scenebuilder-$version.jar \
com.oracle.javafx.scenebuilder.app.SceneBuilderApp
```

## Scene Builder Kit ##

To build and install the Scene Builder Kit in your local repository, run:

`mvn clean install -f kit`

The custom controls of the Scene Builder kit can be used in your project.
You can add it as a regular dependency to the build of your app:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.gluonhq.scenebuilder</groupId>
  <artifactId>kit</artifactId>
  <version>$version</version>
</dependency>
```

## Code Style

To ensure that new code formatting matches the requirements for Pull Requests,
the Maven Checkstyle plugin can be used to create a report listing possibly coding 
style violations.

Contributors can check for code-style violations in their code by running the Checkstyle Maven goal. The checkstyle configuration is currently in a very early stage and only checks for empty blocks, extra white space, padding and empty lines.

To run the plugin:

```
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
```

There will be a report for each sub-project, one for `app` and one for `kit`.

* Kit: `kit/target/site/checkstyle.html`
* App: `kit/target/site/checkstyle.html`
