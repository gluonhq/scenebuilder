## Building Scene Builder ##

### Requisites ###

Gluon Scene Builder is frequently released, and this is only required in case you want to fork and build your local version of Scene Builder.

These are the requisites:

* A recent version of [JDK 11 or later](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) for building 'master' branch
* A recent version of [JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) for building '8u-dev' branch

### How to build Scene Builder ###

To build the Scene Builder services, on the project's root, run:

`./gradlew clean build`

It will create a partial shadow cross-platform jar under `app/build/libs/scenebuilder-$version.jar`, that doesn't include the JavaFX dependencies.

### How to run Scene Builder ###

You can run it with Gradle:

`./gradlew run`

or you can run the partial shadow jar, providing you have downloaded the JavaFX SDK from [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/):

`java --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk-$javafxVersion/lib --add-modules javafx.web,javafx.fxml,javafx.swing,javafx.media --add-opens=javafx.fxml/javafx.fxml=ALL-UNNAMED -cp app/build/libs/scenebuilder-$version.jar com.oracle.javafx.scenebuilder.app.SceneBuilderApp                                                           

## Scene Builder Kit ##

To build and install the Scene Builder Kit in your local repository, run:

`./gradlew clean :kit:install`

The custom controls of the Scene Builder kit can be used in your project. 
You can add it as a regular dependency to the build of your app:

```
repositories {
    mavenLocal()
}

dependencies {
    implementation ('com.gluonhq.scenebuilder:scenebuilder-kit:$version') { transitive = false }
}
```
